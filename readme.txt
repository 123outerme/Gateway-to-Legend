The word "I" refers to the creator of Gateway to Legend, Stephen Policelli.
I did not write or modify the graphics library, SDL2, any of its extensions or previous versions, or any
of its code.
I did not create the font file PX_437_ITT_BIOS_X.ttf. However, I did slightly modify it, adding in one
character.
I originally wrote the code behind Gateway to Legend.

TL;DR version (which is not a substitute for the license):

You may freely share and alter the font for any purpose
You must give appropriate credit (which includes the author's name and a link to the original material)

No warranties are given - whatever you do, I will not be held liable

(and yes, I stole the TL;DR version from the font pack readme)
