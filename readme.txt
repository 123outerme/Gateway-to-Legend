 Gateway-to-Legend
 >> Legal Stuff <<

The word "I" refers to the creator of Gateway to Legend, Stephen Policelli.
I did not write or modify the graphics library, SDL2, any of its extensions or previous versions, or any
of its code.
I did not create the font file PX_437_ITT_BIOS_X.ttf. However, I did slightly modify it, adding in one
character.
I originally wrote the code behind Gateway to Legend.

TL;DR version (which is not a substitute for the license):

You may freely share and alter the font for any purpose
You must give appropriate credit (which includes the author's name and a link to the original material)
If you distribute your own adaptations, do so under a compatible license
No warranties are given - whatever you do, I will not be held liable

(and yes, I stole the TL;DR version from the font pack readme)

All sounds used are royalty-free. Some sounds have different licenses, so I added the specific author and
license information into the metadata of each sound file. They all have links to the type of license, or
no license, in the case of those that are in Public Domain.
