## Basic Guidelines
* Respect other people's work; if they don't want you to change their work, and it works, don't.
* Be respectful to each others opinions as well; if someone disagrees with your edit or vice versa, resolve it peacefully.
* Over all, make clear, insightful, or helpful edits that don't detract from the quality of the file.

## Code Styles
* Match your code styles to the other authors'
* Write your code to be as clear as possible without comments
* Write comments explaining anything not simple that you added

## Editing Plaintext
* Write with a clear, concise, and unbiased tone. Disclose when you are straying away from fact.
* For documentation, describe as clearly as possible the overview of the feature, then go into a more technical detail for complicated features.
