    <h1>Gateway to Legend</h1>
    <h2>Starting a New Map-Pack</h2>
    <p><strong>Select "New" from the menu after launching the toolchain. Input all the data it asks.</strong> After that, a window will launch with your tileset on it, and instructions. <strong>Navigate the cursor to the tile it asks you to find and press Space on it</strong>. Finish and it will naturally quit. If you make a mistake, press Enter before you complete the map-pack, and try again with Map-Pack Wizard -> Edit Tile Equates.</p>
    
    <h2>Creating Maps</h2>
    <p>To create a map, load your map-pack then select <em>Map Creator</em>. You can load an existing map from your map-pack or start a new one. A new one will load all blank.<br />
        Place down tiles using <kbd>Interact<kbd> <em>(default Space)</em>, and maneuver using <kbd>Up/Down/Left/Right</kbd> <em>(default WASD)</em>. Switch between placing tiles and objects using <em>Attack (default Left Shift)</em>. Objects are ordered as follows:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Blank (walkable) tile</li>
      <li>Collision (unwalkable) tile</li>
      <li>Buttons 1, 2, and 3</li>
      <li>Doors 1, 2, and 3</li>
      <li>Teleporter</li>
      <li>Spikes</li>
      <li>Gateway</li>
      <li>Enemies 1, 2 and 3</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Maps are loaded in like such: <strong>first map -> top-most left-most map, second -> top-most, one right of left-most map, etc., wrapping around every 10. Map #10 is the right-most map of the first row, and #11 is left-most map of the next row</strong>. <br / >
	  The tileset should be made of 48x48 tiles, and it should be formatted with rows of 8 tiles and columns of 16, so <strong>the size of the tileset image is 768 x 384 px</strong>. Maps in scripts are referred to as their line number, minus 1. The map on line 1 would be map ID 0.</p>
    
    <h2>Creating Scripts</h2>
    <p>A script is a line of data that corresponds to a certain action. This allows you to customize your experience with text boxes, bosses, teleporting, etc. <br/ >
      To create a script, pick the Script Editor option in the Tools menu. Select which type of action you would like to program and hit start. Maneuver using <kbd>Up/Down/Left/Right</kbd> <em>(default WASD)</em>, and place the X,Y coordinate of your script using <kbd>Interact<kbd> <em>(default Space)</em>. <wbr />
      Then, you must set the width and height of your script. To change the amount your w/h increment and decrement by from a 1/8 of a tile to a full tile, press <em>Attack (default Left Shift)</em>. To switch back, press it again. This option is especially useful for defining the size of a boss.</p>
