    <h1>Gateway to Legend</h1>
	<p>Here are our frequently asked questions.</p>
	<hr />
	<ol>
	  <li>What systems is this compatible with?</li>
	  <p>Gateway is compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux machines.</p>
	  <li>How do you create a map-pack? What sort of standards should I adhere to?</li>
	  <p><strong>Select "New" from the menu after launching the toolchain</strong>. Input all the data it asks. After that, a window will launch with your tileset on it, and instructions. <strong>Navigate the cursor to the tile it asks you to find and press Space on it</strong>. Finish and it will naturally quit. If you make a mistake, press Enter before you complete the map-pack, and try again with Map-Pack Wizard -> Edit Tile Equates. <br / >
	  Maps are loaded in like such: <strong>first map -> top-most left-most map, second -> top-most next to left-most map, etc., wrapping around every 10. Map #10 is the right-most map of the first row, and #11 is left-most map of the next row</strong>. <br / >
	  The tileset should be made of 48x48 tiles, and it should be formatted with rows of 8 tiles and columns of 16, so <strong>the size of the tileset image is 768 x 384 px</strong>. For more information, see <a href="https://github.com/123outerme/Gateway-to-Legend/wiki/Toolchain">the wiki page.</a></p>
	  <li>How do I reset my control scheme?</li>
	  <p><strong>On the main menu, press Ctrl+R</strong> and the control scheme will reset to default (WASD + Space + Left Ctrl).</p>
