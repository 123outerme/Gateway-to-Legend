  <h1>Gateway to Legend</h1>
  <p>A Puzzle-RPG hybrid game. <br />
  The core gameplay involves solving puzzles, collecting money, and defeating bosses. <br />
  This is, of course, nothing new. However, integrated directly into the core of the game is the ability to create your own adventures through the map-pack feature. <br />
  Map-packs are sets of maps, save files, spritesheets, and scripts that allow deep customization of user-generated experiences. Creating maps is easy with the map-pack toolchain program, included in the download.</p>
