  <h1>Gateway to Legend</h1>
  <p>A Puzzle-RPG hybrid game. The core gameplay involves solving puzzles, collecting money, and defeating bosses. <br />
  <br />
  This is, of course, nothing new. However, integrated directly into the core of the game is the ability to <strong>create your own adventures through the map-pack feature!</strong> <br />
  Map-packs are sets of maps, save files, spritesheets, and scripts that allow deep customization of user-generated experiences. <strong>Creating maps is easy with the map-pack toolchain program</strong>, included in the download.</p>
