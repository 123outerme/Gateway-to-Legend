# SDL-Seekers
A Puzzle-RPG hybrid game. More details soon, but in a nutshell it's remake/port of
the TI-84+ game I made when I first started to get recognition as a novice programmer.
The game was way too hard-coded, I promised map packs that I never released, and at least
one level was always broken. Here to fix those problems, give it solid graphics, and make
the puzzles interesting!
