~~ Gateway to Legend Toolchain ~~

The Toolchain application is a set of tools that mapmakers can use to create their own puzzle adventures! These
include the Map Creator, Map-Pack Header Wizard, and the Script Creator.

~ Map Creator ~
Use this to make individual maps, which you paste into your map file. It outputs to
(folder where Gateway is downloaded)/output/map.txt.
It asks you if you want to make a new map, and if not, asks where the map is that you want to edit, all in the
console window. After that, a window pops up, and this is your map editor.

Controls:
W - Up
A - Left
S - Down
D - Right
Space - Place tile/event
LShift - Switch between placing/seeing tiles and events


~ Map-Pack Header Wizard ~
For the first part, you input information through the console window. Then, after everything is added, you select
sprites from the specified tileset to define them as the events/items/enemies you want them to be.

Controls:
W - Up
A - Left
S - Down
D - Right
Space - Select the tile highlighted
Enter / Esc / Exiting window: Quit early. Upon completing all required selections, the window will close 
                              automatically. If you do any of those three, you can quit before the file is
                              written to.
